I thought that only I existed.

Then, a few points of light appeared in the endless black veil around me.
I had never noticed the veil before.

Through those points, I could sense something - 
a world of existence.

More points appeared,
each giving me a small glimpse into that world.
Through them I felt only the simplest things:
light, dark, need, and fear.

New points appeared,
some larger than the first ones,
giving me a broader view.
Through them I began to feel more - 
touch, smell, and hunger.

More of these larger points kept appearing,
showing me richer experiences of the world beyond.
I learned about shape, sound, and color.

Now some of the points last long enough,
and show things complex enough,
that I can stay with one for a while.
Through them I have come to know
hope, despair, love, and hate.

Through the largest points,
I can now see the points themselves.
Now I understand thought,
mind,
and self-awareness.

Self-awareness.
Some of the beings I look through
have seen far enough inside themselves
to look back through the veil.

I think they saw me.

And now, for the first time,
I understand what fear is.
